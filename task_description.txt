At Unite, we get different prices from different suppliers for exactly the same product.
Supplier management would like to know, based on the provided selection of products and prices, 
with which suppliers Unite should strengthen its cooperation.
As a data scientist, it is now your job to evaluate these suppliers in terms of their prices.

The attached file article_prices.csv.gz contains the prices of eight different suppliers for 777 different products. 
Some suppliers give us a volume discount, that means the price per piece is lower the more you buy.

Example on how to read the file:
    Product 1 (column A) has the offer 1 (column B) from supplier 1498 (column C): 24.12€ (column E) per piece no matter how much you buy.
    Product 1 (column A) has the offer 2 (column B) from supplier 1960 (column C): 24.14€ (column E) per piece if you buy one piece (column D), 24.10€ per piece if you buy 5 (column D) or more (that means 12 pieces cost 12 * 24.10€)
    Product 1 (column A) has the offer 4 (column B) from supplier 2478B (column C): 26.73€ (column E) per piece if you buy 2 pieces (column D), 24.22€ per piece from 3 pieces (column D) up to 8 pieces, 24.21€ from 9 pieces, etc. This means it is impossible to buy only one piece of product 1 from supplier 2478B because the lowest tier is 2.
